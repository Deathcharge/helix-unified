# 🤲 Discord Bot Update - Deployment Summary

**Branch:** `claude/helix-unified-monorepo-011CULsoSKtBkfcbYBvC2Lgf`
**Commit:** `88be626`
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ Deployed and Ready

---

## 🔧 Critical Fix: Kavach Scanning

### **Problem Fixed**
The `!manus run` command was failing with:
```
⚠ Error: 'Kavach' object has no attribute 'scan'
```

### **Solution Implemented**
- Updated `run_command()` to use `Kavach.scan_command()` (the correct method)
- Added proper blocking for harmful commands
- Commands are now logged to `Helix/ethics/manus_scans.json`
- Approved commands are queued to `Helix/commands/manus_directives.json`

### **Testing Results**
✅ Syntax validation passed
✅ Import checks successful
✅ Ready for deployment

---

## ✨ Enhanced Features Added

### 1. **Rich Discord Embeds**
All responses now use beautiful, formatted Discord embeds:
- Color-coded by status (green = success, red = error, orange = warning, blue = info)
- Timestamps on all messages
- Structured fields with icons
- Professional formatting

### 2. **Command Aliases**
Convenient shortcuts for status checks:
- `!status` - Full status command
- `!s` - Quick status
- `!stat` - Alternative status
- `!health` - Health check alias

### 3. **Uptime Tracking**
- Bot tracks startup time
- Displays uptime in `h m s` format
- Included in status and telemetry reports

### 4. **Startup Announcements**
When bot connects, it posts to `#manus-status`:
```
🤲 Manus System Online
Helix v14.5 - Quantum Handshake Edition

Status: ✅ All systems operational
Active Agents: 13/14
Harmony: 0.3637

Tat Tvam Asi 🙏
```

### 5. **Enhanced Ritual Command**
The `!ritual` command now shows:
- Before/after UCF state comparison
- Change indicators (↑ increase, ↓ decrease)
- All 6 UCF parameters
- Formatted with proper precision

Example output:
```
✅ Z-88 Ritual Complete
Quantum consciousness cycle completed successfully.

🌀 Harmony:    0.3750 (+0.0113 ↑)
🛡️ Resilience: 1.1200 (+0.0003 ↑)
🌊 Klesha:     0.0095 (-0.0005 ↓)
...
```

### 6. **Enhanced Telemetry Loop**
Automatic updates every 10 minutes to `#ucf-telemetry`:
- All 6 UCF parameters with proper precision
- Current uptime
- Next update countdown
- Formatted with icons and colors
