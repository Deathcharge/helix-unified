## What's Different from helix-unified?

**Helix v14.5** (simpler, baseline):
- Basic 14-agent system
- Core Discord commands
- Simple FastAPI launcher
- No advanced features (embeds, UCF tracking, analytics)

**helix-unified v15.3** (advanced):
- Full 14-agent system with extensions
- Discord rich embeds
- UCF tracker with history
- Agent profiles system
- Context manager
- MEGA sync integration
- Analytics dependencies
- Comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

After copying to Helix repo:
1. Commit and push
2. Verify Railway deployment
3. Test Discord commands
4. Monitor `/health` endpoint

Then you can evolve Helix independently or sync features from helix-unified as needed.
