# üéØ CRITICAL FIX: mega.py --no-deps Solution

**Branch**: `claude/fix-mega-no-deps-011CUNUCTNywBRQRhLqfXvJ2`
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to Merge
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks Railway Deployment

---

## üö® The Problem

Main branch currently has split requirements (`requirements-backend.txt`) but **Railway is still failing** with:

```
[ 9/25] RUN python3 -c "import Cryptodome..."
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cryptodome'
```

### Why This Happens

1. `requirements-backend.txt` line 16 has `mega.py`
2. `mega.py` package has **pycrypto as a hard dependency** in its metadata
3. When pip installs mega.py, it automatically installs pycrypto
4. pycrypto and pycryptodome **conflict at the module level**
5. Even with `uninstall/reinstall`, the conflict persists
6. Verification step fails: `import Cryptodome` ‚Üí ModuleNotFoundError

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

**Install mega.py with `--no-deps` flag** to prevent pycrypto installation:

### Changes Made

**1. requirements-backend.txt** (line 15-16):
```diff
- # MEGA Sync
- mega.py
+ # MEGA Sync - pycryptodome only (mega.py installed separately with --no-deps in Dockerfile)
  pycryptodome
```

**2. Dockerfile** (line 15-26):
```diff
  # CRITICAL FIX: Install pycryptodome FIRST
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pycryptodome

- # Install Python dependencies (mega.py might try to install pycrypto)
+ # Install Python dependencies (requirements-backend.txt excludes mega.py)
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

- # FORCE: Remove any pycrypto that snuck in, reinstall pycryptodome
- RUN pip uninstall -y pycrypto || true
- RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall pycryptodome
+ # Install mega.py WITHOUT dependencies (prevents pycrypto installation)
+ RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --no-deps mega.py

- # Verify installation (this will appear in build logs)
+ # Verify Cryptodome installation
  RUN python3 -c "import Cryptodome; print('‚úÖ Cryptodome installed:', Cryptodome.__version__)"
  RUN python3 -c "from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES; print('‚úÖ AES import works')"
```

## üéØ How It Works

### Installation Order
1. ‚úÖ Install pycryptodome **first** (explicit)
2. ‚úÖ Install all requirements from requirements-backend.txt (mega.py excluded)
3. ‚úÖ Install mega.py with `--no-deps` (prevents pycrypto installation)
4. ‚úÖ Verify Cryptodome works

### Why --no-deps Works
- `--no-deps` tells pip to install **only** mega.py
- Skips all dependency resolution
- pycrypto never gets installed
- pycryptodome remains the sole Crypto implementation
- No conflicts!

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After merging this PR, Railway should:

**Build Phase**:
- [ ] Install pycryptodome successfully
- [ ] Install requirements-backend.txt (without mega.py)
- [ ] Install mega.py with --no-deps
- [ ] Verify: `‚úÖ Cryptodome installed: 3.23.0`
- [ ] Verify: `‚úÖ AES import works`
- [ ] Complete build without errors

**Runtime Phase** (deploy_v15.3.sh):
- [ ] Runtime verification: `‚úÖ Cryptodome version: 3.23.0`
- [ ] Runtime verification: `‚úÖ AES import successful`
- [ ] Bot starts: `üåÄ MEGA connected. Grimoire seed active.`
- [ ] No ImportError in logs

**Discord Commands**:
- [ ] `!status` ‚Üí Shows MEGA: ACTIVE
- [ ] `!testmega` ‚Üí Uploads test file successfully
- [ ] `!heartbeat` ‚Üí Saves to MEGA successfully

## üîó Related Context

### Previous Attempts
- **PR #15**: Added Crypto import aliases to bot/mega_sync.py ‚úÖ
- **PR #16**: Fixed Dockerfile COPY commands ‚úÖ
- **PR #17**: Added documentation ‚úÖ
- **Manus commits**: Split requirements structure ‚úÖ
- **Current main**: Still uses uninstall/reinstall (fails) ‚ùå

### Why Previous Fixes Weren't Enough
1. Import aliases work **only if** Cryptodome module exists
2. Dockerfile COPY fixes were necessary but insufficient
3. Uninstall/reinstall approach doesn't work because:
   - pycrypto is already compiled and in site-packages
   - Module level conflicts persist even after reinstall
   - Python's import system caches broken imports

### The Root Issue
mega.py is an **abandoned library** (last update 2019) with:
- Hardcoded pycrypto dependency
- No pycryptodome support
- No active maintenance

**Strategic solution** (documented in SYNC_STRATEGY.md):
- v15.3: mega.py with --no-deps (this fix - stopgap)
- v15.4: Migrate to rclone (production solution)
- v15.5: Remove mega.py entirely

---

## üéØ Summary

**What**: Install mega.py with `--no-deps` to prevent pycrypto conflicts
**Why**: mega.py's pycrypto dependency breaks pycryptodome
**How**: Remove mega.py from requirements, install separately with --no-deps
**Impact**: Railway builds succeed, MEGA sync works, deployment unblocked

**Files Changed**: 2
**Lines Changed**: +6, -8
**Risk Level**: Low (only changes dependency installation order)
**Testing**: Automated via Dockerfile verification steps

---

**This completes the MEGA sync fix for the split requirements structure.** üöÄ

Railway should now deploy successfully!
