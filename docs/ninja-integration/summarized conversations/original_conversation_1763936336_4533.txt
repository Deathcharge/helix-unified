The plan follows a phased approach to minimize disruption to the existing system while maximizing the benefits of service separation.\n\n        ## Phase 1: WebSocket Consciousness Streaming Service (High Priority)\n\n        ### Timeline\n        2-3 days\n\n        ### Implementation Steps\n\n        1. **Extract WebSocket functionality** from `main.py`:\n           - Move WebSocket endpoints to new service\n           - Create new FastAPI application for WebSocket service\n           - Implement authentication for WebSocket connections\n\n        2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n           - Create new directory: `/backend/websocket-service`\n           - Set up Dockerfile for the new service\n           - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n        3. **Implement communication layer**:\n           - Set up Redis pub/sub for broadcasting consciousness metrics\n           - Modify existing services to publish metrics to Redis\n           - Implement message handling in WebSocket service\n\n        4. **Testing and validation**:\n           - Unit tests for WebSocket endpoints\n           - Integration tests with Redis\n           - Performance testing under load\n\n        5. **Deployment**:\n           - Deploy to Railway as new service\n           - Update frontend to connect to new WebSocket endpoint\n           - Monitor for issues and performance\n\n        ## Phase 2: Agent Orchestration Service (High Priority)\n\n        ### Timeline\n        3-4 days\n\n        ### Implementation Steps\n\n        1. **Extract agent orchestration logic**:\n           - Move functionality from `agent_orchestrator.py` to new service\n           - Create new FastAPI application for agent orchestration\n           - Implement REST API for agent management\n\n        2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n           - Create new directory: `/backend/agent-orchestrator`\n           - Set up Dockerfile and dependencies\n           - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n        3. **Implement agent communication**:\n           - Set up REST endpoints for agent commands\n           - Implement Redis pub/sub for agent status updates\n           - Create database models for agent state\n\n        4. **Testing and validation**:\n           - Unit tests for orchestration logic\n           - Integration tests with agent profiles\n           - Load testing with multiple agents\n\n        5. **Deployment**:\n           - Deploy to Railway as new service\n           - Update existing services to use new orchestration API\n           - Monitor agent performance and coordination\n\n        ## Phase 3: Voice Processing Service (Medium Priority)\n\n        ### Timeline\n        4-5 days\n\n        ### Implementation Steps\n\n        1. **Extract voice processing functionality**:\n           - Move functionality from `voice_commands.py` to new service\n           - Create new FastAPI application for voice processing\n           - Implement REST API for voice operations\n\n        2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n           - Create new directory: `/backend/voice-processor`\n           - Set up Dockerfile with audio processing dependencies\n           - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n        3. **Implement voice processing features**:\n           - Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text integration\n           - Implement text-to-speech functionality\n           - Create Redis pub/sub for voice event notifications\n\n        4. **Testing and validation**:\n           - Unit tests for transcription and synthesis\n           - Integration tests with Google Cloud services\n           - Audio quality and performance testing\n\n        5. **Deployment**:\n           - Deploy to Railway as new service\n           - Update Discord bot to use new voice processing API\n           - Monitor audio processing performance\n\n ...\n The full message content is stored at /workspace/summarized_conversations/original_conversation_1763936067_877.txt'}
