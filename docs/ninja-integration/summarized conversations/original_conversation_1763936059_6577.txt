The plan follows a phased approach to minimize disruption to the existing system while maximizing the benefits of service separation.\n\n## Phase 1: WebSocket Consciousness Streaming Service (High Priority)\n\n### Timeline\n2-3 days\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Extract WebSocket functionality** from `main.py`:\n   - Move WebSocket endpoints to new service\n   - Create new FastAPI application for WebSocket service\n   - Implement authentication for WebSocket connections\n\n2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n   - Create new directory: `/backend/websocket-service`\n   - Set up Dockerfile for the new service\n   - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n3. **Implement communication layer**:\n   - Set up Redis pub/sub for broadcasting consciousness metrics\n   - Modify existing services to publish metrics to Redis\n   - Implement message handling in WebSocket service\n\n4. **Testing and validation**:\n   - Unit tests for WebSocket endpoints\n   - Integration tests with Redis\n   - Performance testing under load\n\n5. **Deployment**:\n   - Deploy to Railway as new service\n   - Update frontend to connect to new WebSocket endpoint\n   - Monitor for issues and performance\n\n## Phase 2: Agent Orchestration Service (High Priority)\n\n### Timeline\n3-4 days\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Extract agent orchestration logic**:\n   - Move functionality from `agent_orchestrator.py` to new service\n   - Create new FastAPI application for agent orchestration\n   - Implement REST API for agent management\n\n2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n   - Create new directory: `/backend/agent-orchestrator`\n   - Set up Dockerfile and dependencies\n   - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n3. **Implement agent communication**:\n   - Set up REST endpoints for agent commands\n   - Implement Redis pub/sub for agent status updates\n   - Create database models for agent state\n\n4. **Testing and validation**:\n   - Unit tests for orchestration logic\n   - Integration tests with agent profiles\n   - Load testing with multiple agents\n\n5. **Deployment**:\n   - Deploy to Railway as new service\n   - Update existing services to use new orchestration API\n   - Monitor agent performance and coordination\n\n## Phase 3: Voice Processing Service (Medium Priority)\n\n### Timeline\n4-5 days\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Extract voice processing functionality**:\n   - Move functionality from `voice_commands.py` to new service\n   - Create new FastAPI application for voice processing\n   - Implement REST API for voice operations\n\n2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n   - Create new directory: `/backend/voice-processor`\n   - Set up Dockerfile with audio processing dependencies\n   - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n3. **Implement voice processing features**:\n   - Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text integration\n   - Implement text-to-speech functionality\n   - Create Redis pub/sub for voice event notifications\n\n4. **Testing and validation**:\n   - Unit tests for transcription and synthesis\n   - Integration tests with Google Cloud services\n   - Audio quality and performance testing\n\n5. **Deployment**:\n   - Deploy to Railway as new service\n   - Update Discord bot to use new voice processing API\n   - Monitor audio processing performance\n\n## Phase 4: Zapier Integration Service (Medium Priority)\n\n### Timeline\n3-4 days\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Extract Zapier integration logic**:\n   - Move functionality from `zapier_integration.py` to new service\n   - Create new FastAPI application for Zapier integration\n   - Implement webhook endpoints\n\n2. **Create service infrastructure**:\n   - Create new directory: `/backend/zapier-service`\n   - Set up Dockerfile and dependencies\n   - Configure Railway deployment settings\n\n3. **Implement integration features**:\n   - Set up webhook handling and validation\n   - Implement event queuing with Redis\n   - Create dat...\n The full message content is stored at /workspace/summarized_conversations/original_conversation_1763935919_776.txt'}
